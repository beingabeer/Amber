## How does it work?

To get started, first create a new album. When adding an album cover logo, it's best to have a resolution of at least 512x512 and to use common image formats such as JPG, JPEG, or PNG.

After an album is created you will then be able to add/upload songs. Currently supported file types are WAV, MP3, and OGG.
